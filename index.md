Hello there! I'm Ayushi Agarwal, a passionate graduate student pursuing my MS in Computer Science at <a href="https://asu.edu" target="_blank"> Arizona State University</a>. With a strong foundation in deep learning and a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies, I strive to make a positive impact through my work.

As an aspiring data scientist, I have focused my studies on areas such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning. These fields fascinate me because of their potential to revolutionize how we interact with machines and how machines understand the world around us.

Proficient in Python, Java, and other programming languages, I love to dive deep into complex problems and develop innovative solutions. I have hands-on experience with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Keras, enabling me to implement state-of-the-art algorithms with ease. Whether it's building computer vision models or tackling challenges in natural language processing, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what is possible and finding practical applications for cutting-edge research.

In addition to my technical skills, I am an effective communicator and team player. I have collaborated with renowned researchers, both as a research scholar at Arizona State University and as a visiting researcher at the Florida Institute of Technology. These experiences have allowed me to contribute to impactful projects in areas such as medical imaging and network packet analysis.

During my time as a graduate teaching assistant, I have had the opportunity to guide and mentor students, helping them grasp complex concepts and develop their programming skills. I believe that effective communication and knowledge sharing are crucial for fostering a strong learning community.

Beyond my academic and technical pursuits, I am proud to have been the Chess Team Captain at BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus. Through my leadership and dedication, our team achieved remarkable success in various tournaments, earning me the recognition of "Best Chess Player of the Batch 2018 - 2022." I was also honored with the Director's All-Round Achievement Medal for my well-rounded contributions to the university.

In recognition of my academic excellence, I have been awarded the prestigious New American University Scholarship at Arizona State University and received scholarships at BITS Pilani Dubai Campus for maintaining an exceptional CGPA throughout my undergraduate studies.

Through this website, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and projects related to deep learning and its diverse applications. I invite you to explore my portfolio, where you'll find examples of my expertise in implementing cutting-edge algorithms and solving real-world challenges.

I am always open to exciting collaboration opportunities and projects that push the boundaries of deep learning. If you have any questions, or suggestions, or simply want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
