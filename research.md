### Research üîé
I am currently interested and researching on the following topics pertaining to Deep Learning:
* Topics to add 1
* Topics to add 2

### Publications üìù
* Can NLP Models 'Identify', 'Distinguish', and 'Justify' Questions that Don't have a Definitive Answer?
* Constraint-Based Multi-organ Identification in CT Images using Unsupervised Learning
* [LPRNet: A Novel Approach for Novelty Detection in Networking Packets](https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=13&Issue=2&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=13)
* [Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms and Feature Extraction Methods for Sentiment Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9633882)
* [Genetic Algorithm and Ensemble Learning Aided Text Classification using Support Vector Machines](https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume12No8/Paper_30-Genetic_Algorithm_and_Ensemble_Learning_Aided.pdf)

Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zba5g9wAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) for more details about the publications I have been a part of. 


### Projects üíª
- [Is Transformation Better than Resampling for Lesion Segmentation Using Deep Learning in Dermatology?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4015031)

I have linked the implementations of the above projects available on my [Github](https://github.com/ayushiagarwal268).
